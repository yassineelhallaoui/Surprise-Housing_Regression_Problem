## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The Ridge Regression model is showing a very good performance using the R2 score as evaluation metric :
    - Train dataset : r_square_value : 0.92
   - Test set r_square_value : 0.91
- The most 5 features that explain well the regression model are :
   - Feature: GrLivArea: 0.315
   - Feature: RoofMatl_CompShg: 0.182
   - Feature: OverallQual: 0.169
   - Feature: YearBuilt: 0.141
   - Feature: RoofMatl_Tar&Grv: 0.129
